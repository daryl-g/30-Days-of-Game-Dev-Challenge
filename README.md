# 30 Days of Game Development Challenge

- Create a game within 30 days of October 2024 using Godot and _some language_ (could be C, C++, or Python).
- Main goal: learn Godot and have fun along the way!

## Idea

- A Flappy Bird clone, but for Halloween.
- Replace the traditional bird with a crow. _(Gotta draw the crow sprite...somehow? Maybe using Blender?)_
- Gaps can decrease and increase size randomly, and move at a random, but reasonable speed.
