# Squash the Creeps 3D demo

![Squash the Creeps final demo](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/squash-the-creeps-final.gif "Squash the Creeps final demo game")

- Part of my 30 days of Game Development challenge.
- See the `main` branch for more information since this branch is mainly for files related to the Squash the Creeps prototype.
- Followed the [demo](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html) from the official Godot Engine's documentation.
  - 90 to 95% of these files should be very similar to the original tutorial.
  - I added more comments to the code and each scene for future references.
  - I also added small tweaks to make the design a bit unique.
