# 30 Days of Game Development Challenge

- Create a game within 30 days of October 2024 using Godot and GDScript.
- Main goal: learn Godot and have fun along the way!

## Idea

- Recreate Gravity Falls' Northwest Manor using Godot's 3D engine (but without the Northwest part).
- Murder Mystery/Escape room-esque game? Basically, horror(-ish) puzzle game for Halloween.
- Potential names: Pembroke Mansion, Blackwood Mansion (kinda like it!), Haverhill Mansion, Thornhill Mansion
